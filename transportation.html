                <h4>Getting to Taniti</h4>
                <p>Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week.<br> Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes.<br> Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few years. </p>
                <h4>Getting Around Taniti</h4>
                <p>Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day.<br> Private buses serve the rest of the island.<br> Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport.<br> Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law).<br> Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable.<br> Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.</p>
